     <p>I’m so excited for the holidays this year! I have always been the person that insists on waiting until after Thanksgiving to decorate but for some reason this year I’m like 10 times more excited. November 1st I was already out stocking up on my Christmas decor!.Holidays can be a tough time in choosing comfortable outfits but as well as look stylish.</p>
    <p>I found this one and was instantly taken. I’ve never shied away from anything off-the-shoulder, so it was an obvious choice. I also ordered this burgundy lace dress for another event – I loved the subtle burgundy tones with the more conservative but still sexy silhouette. I also had my eye on this fun fit-and-flare dress. Tadashi Shoji dresses are another great option for the holidays. I have a couple and always get tons of compliments when I wear them. I love this one and how amazing is this one?! Below are a few more perfect dresses for the holidays just because I can’t get enough.</p>
