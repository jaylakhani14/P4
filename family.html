     <p>Girls it’s that time of the year – family photo time! Are you planning on taking family pictures this year? The last time we took family pictures was in 2019. They turned out absolutely gorgeous but the process left me traumatized (hence no 2020 pics). Kids were grumpy, not really co-operating and Jay was less than thrilled to be there.I am putting my foot down and getting ready for this year’s session. Still trying to decide what outfits / styles we’re going to do.</p>
