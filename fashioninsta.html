When you finally look up from your phone, you realise youâ€™ve spent two whole days scrolling through feeds â€“ and youâ€™re still in your dressing gown, with no idea what to wear (weâ€™ve all been there). Which sort of defeats the point. <br><br>
       Hi Guys! Thanks so much for visiting FashionInsta! Iâ€™m Jay Lakhani (no middle name ðŸ™‚ ) I was born in Rajkot, India. Iâ€™m half Indian, half Arab. I started my company in November 2014, canâ€™t believe itâ€™s been that long! I started this online diary as a way to share my favorite sales, buys and fashion finds. Now I share everything from family and travel to fashion.
            <br><br>
            I currently live in Las Vegas with my wife Aashi and our two kids Aalisha and Raniya!!
            <br><br>
            From the bottom of my heart thank you for reading and following along! I read all your comments and truly enjoy connecting with you all! XX Jay</p>
